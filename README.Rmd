# HURDAT

This R package currently aims to reorganize the NOAA HURDAT2 dataset for Atlantic, East Pacific and Central Pacific-basin tropical cyclones and present it in a cleaner format.

The Atlantic basin dataset covers all cyclones that have developed in the Atlantic Ocean. The eastern Pacific datasets cover cyclones in the Pacifc from the United States/Mexico coastlines to -140&deg;W where the cyclone entered what is referred to as the central Pacific basin. The central Pacific basin extends westward to -180&deg;W.
