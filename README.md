# HURDAT

This R package currently aims to reorganize the NOAA HURDAT2 dataset for
Atlantic, East Pacific and Central Pacific-basin tropical cyclones and
present it in a cleaner format.

The Atlantic basin dataset covers all cyclones that have developed in
the Atlantic Ocean. The eastern Pacific datasets cover cyclones in the
Pacific from the United States/Mexico coastlines to -140°W where the
cyclone entered what is referred to as the central Pacific basin. The
central Pacific basin extends westward to -180°W.
